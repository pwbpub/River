The goal of this project is to create a simple book recommendation application. The app will have a minimalist UI and a LLM powering recommendations for users. 
Users will input preferences such as their favorite genres, authors and styles and receive 1-3 new books to consider reading.
The sentiment of this project is to create something that flows simply and is natural for the end user. Quality over quantity of features.

My goal is to get a functional application running that can later be expanded into something more specialized and feature-rich.
Potential Features:  
-abstract text/conversational input and outputs  
-detailed information on the recommended books(long descriptions, common reader reviews/sentiments, links to best outside resources or purchase options)  


Front: ReactJS
Back: NodeJS, MongoDB, RestAPI, OpenAI GPT, Axios
Versions are consistently updated to latest.
