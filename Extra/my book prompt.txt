Weaving the Web
I loved learning about early web/internet tech from the 90's. The story of building the infrastructure for what we use today was fascinating.

Hot Water Music
Bukowski's unapologetic and honest short stories were refreshing and comedic. At times too dark, but mostly funny and witty- despite their crudeness.

The Hobbit
Have originally been intended as a children's book, I loved how it was easy to read yet still painted a detailed and imaginative picture. The story did not spend too long *trying* to develop characters...it let their actions and words do the work.
